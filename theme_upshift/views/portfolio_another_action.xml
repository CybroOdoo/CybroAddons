                                    <p>When our power of choice is untrammeled

                                        to
                                        do what we like best,
                                        every pleasure is to be welcomed and

                                        pain avoided. But in certain
                                        circumstances
                                        and owing to the claims
                                        of duty or the obligations of business
                                        it

                                        other greater pleasures, or
                                        else he endures pains to avoid worse
                                        pains.

                                        pain avoided. But in certain

                                        other greater pleasures, or
                                        else he endures pains to avoid worse
